Let's break down the relationship between the files and the steps to apply the fonts in your HTML.

### 1. **Tailwind CSS Configuration (`tailwind.config.js`)**
This is where you configure the overall settings for your Tailwind project. You mentioned you've created a configuration file that includes a preset (`my-preset.js`). The `fontFamily` key under `extend` allows you to add custom font families to your project.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
    content: ["index.html"],  // Specifies which files Tailwind should scan for class names
    presets: [
        require('./my-preset')  // Include your custom preset
    ],
    theme: {
      extend: {
        fontFamily: {
          montserrat: ['Montserrat', 'sans-serif'],  // Define the Montserrat font here
        },
      },
    },
    plugins: [],
}
```

### 2. **Custom Preset (`my-preset.js`)**
This file is an optional way to separate custom configurations, which can be reused across different projects. In this file, you're extending the Tailwind theme with a new font family named `monte` that uses the "Montserrat" font.

```javascript
// my-preset.js
const defaultTheme = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme');
module.exports = {
    darkMode: 'class',
    theme: {
        extend: {
            fontFamily: {
                'monte': ["Montserrat", "sans-serif"],  // Define the 'monte' font family
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. **Tailwind Directives in CSS**
You included `@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, and `@tailwind utilities` in your CSS file. These directives are necessary for Tailwind to generate the required CSS classes based on your configuration. Additionally, you imported the Google Fonts for "Montserrat" and "Comfortaa" at the beginning of your CSS file.

```css
/* Import Google Fonts */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@100..900&display=swap');
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Comfortaa:wght@300..700&display=swap');

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### 4. **Using the Font in HTML**
To apply the "Montserrat" font in your HTML, you can use the class name you defined in your `tailwind.config.js` or `my-preset.js`. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link href="path/to/your/compiled/tailwind.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body class="font-montserrat">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Key Points:
- **In `tailwind.config.js`**: You define `fontFamily: { montserrat: ['Montserrat', 'sans-serif'] }`, making the class `font-montserrat` available.
- **In `my-preset.js`**: The same approach is taken by defining `fontFamily: { monte: ['Montserrat', 'sans-serif'] }`, making `font-monte` available if you use this preset.
- **In your HTML**: Apply the font by using the class name `font-montserrat` or `font-monte` depending on which configuration is active.

### Summary:
- **`tailwind.config.js`** is the main configuration file where you define how Tailwind should behave in your project.
- **`my-preset.js`** is an optional file that allows you to encapsulate some of the Tailwind configurations, such as custom themes, which can be shared across projects.
- You apply the defined fonts in your HTML using the corresponding class name (`font-montserrat`, `font-monte`).

To apply the Montserrat font, simply add the relevant class (like `font-montserrat`) to the HTML elements you want to style with that font.

1. When you say 'which can be reused across different projects,' are you implying that I can use it on other webpages as well?
</li>   

<br>

<li style="font-weight: bold;">
2. "In the extend section, we added fontFamily. Does this create duplication with my-preset since we are adding fontFamily: { monte } again?
</li>

<ul>
</div>

Let's clarify both of your questions:

### 1. **Reusing the Preset Across Different Projects**
When I said, "which can be reused across different projects," I meant that you can take the `my-preset.js` file and use it in any other Tailwind CSS project you work on. This file contains custom configurations, like the `fontFamily`, that can be applied across multiple projects, not just one webpage. 

For example, if you start a new project and want to use the same fonts and other settings you defined in `my-preset.js`, you can copy this preset file into the new project's directory and include it in the new project's `tailwind.config.js`. This helps maintain consistency across projects and saves you from having to redefine the same settings each time.

### 2. **Potential Duplication Between `tailwind.config.js` and `my-preset.js`**
You're correct in noticing that defining `fontFamily` in both `tailwind.config.js` and `my-preset.js` could lead to what seems like duplication. Here’s how it works:

- **In `my-preset.js`**: The `fontFamily` definition here is part of a reusable preset. This means if you include this preset in multiple projects, any settings (like `fontFamily: { monte: ['Montserrat', 'sans-serif'] }`) defined here will be applied in those projects.

- **In `tailwind.config.js`**: When you extend the `fontFamily` in `tailwind.config.js`, you are adding to or overriding the default Tailwind configuration for the specific project where this configuration file is used.

So, yes, if you define `fontFamily` in both files with similar values, it can be considered a duplication. However, this might be done intentionally if you want to have specific settings directly in your `tailwind.config.js` while also using more general or shared configurations from a preset.

**How to Avoid Duplication:**
- **Option 1:** Only define `fontFamily` in `my-preset.js` if you plan to use the preset consistently across projects.
- **Option 2:** If the preset is meant to serve as a baseline and you want to add additional fonts or override settings in a specific project, then extending `fontFamily` in `tailwind.config.js` makes sense.

In essence, you can choose whether to keep your font configurations centralized in the preset or override/add them in the main configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) depending on your needs. If you find that the same configuration is repeated unnecessarily, you might consider simplifying by defining it in one place only.

<div style="background-color: skyblue;">


<p style="font-weight: bold;">
Even if I create a my-preset.js and use it in another project, do I still need to include the @import statement (@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@100..900&display=swap');) if I want to use the 'monte' font?
</p>

</div>

Yes, even if you create a `my-preset.js` file and reuse it across different projects, you will still need to import the font from Google Fonts (or any other font provider) in each project where you want to use the `monte` font (or any other custom font you've defined). This is because the `@import` rule is necessary to ensure that the font files are actually loaded by the browser.

### Why You Still Need the `@import`:

- **Font Availability:** The `fontFamily` configuration in Tailwind or your preset (`my-preset.js`) only tells Tailwind what font names you want to use in your CSS classes. It doesn’t actually load the font files into the browser. The `@import` statement in your CSS file pulls the font files from Google Fonts and makes them available for use in your project.

- **Browser Dependency:** Browsers don’t automatically know where to find the fonts you’re referencing in your CSS. Without the `@import` statement or an equivalent method (like linking a stylesheet), the font won’t be available, and the browser will fall back to a default font.

### How to Manage This:

1. **Include the `@import` Statement:** In each project’s main CSS file (typically the one where you include `@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, and `@tailwind utilities`), include the necessary `@import` statements for any custom fonts you’re using. For example:

    ```css
    /* Import Google Fonts */
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@100..900&display=swap');
    
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

2. **Alternative Methods:** Alternatively, you can link the Google Fonts directly in the `<head>` of your HTML document:

    ```html
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    ```

    This will achieve the same result, ensuring the font is available for your CSS to use.

### Summary:
- **Preset (`my-preset.js`)**: Contains your Tailwind configuration, including the `fontFamily` setup.
- **`@import` Statement**: Required in each project to actually load the font files from Google Fonts into the browser.

Without the `@import` statement or a `<link>` tag in the HTML, the fonts specified in your Tailwind configuration won’t be accessible, even if the `fontFamily` is correctly set up.
